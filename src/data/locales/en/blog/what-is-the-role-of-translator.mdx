We live in a truly connected world. It has never been easier to work, engage, and communicate with businesses and organizations across the globe. However, while this ability to work globally is creating a host of unique opportunities, it has also meant that translators have become an essential part of many businesses. However, what is the role of a translator?

These highly skilled individuals help businesses open up their services to millions of new customers, and knowing when to employ the services of a translator can transform any organization. There is a wide range of translation software available, such as Bing Microsoft Translate, but they are not able to match human translators.

## What is a translator?

While the role of a translator might seem obvious, these specialists cover a huge array of tasks. They are required to have exceptional communication skills, motivation, in-depth comprehension of languages, and high writing skills. They also need to be very good at engaging with people, as translating often requires liaising with several people.

While software can provide basic levels of translation, they are not able to offer a comprehensive solution. That is why the core part of any translatorâ€™s role is to accurately take content from one language and transfer it into another. This might sound like a simple task, but it can be an incredibly complex process to ensure that it makes sense. Quite often, a simple word-for-word translation will not make sense, and in order to do it accurately, translators will need a comprehensive understanding of the subtle colloquialisms and nuances of the destination language.

These subtle linguistic features are essential in ensuring the finished document makes sense and offers the same meaning. In order to do this, a translator will need to have an in-depth understanding of not only the target language but also the topic in question. Some translators will specialize in certain areas, while others will offer a broader spectrum of subjects, carrying our wide-ranging research as part of their offering.

Translators will carry out a wide range of services, but most commonly, they will be required to:

- Understand the meaning of the original document
- Assess it for technical or cultural terminology and colloquialisms
- Determine the best choice of words for the target language
- Create a new document with correct formatting and styling for the new culture
- Edit the document to ensure complete clarity and accuracy

With these skills, the translator will be able to accurately convert any documents or content into another language, giving the reader a smooth and easy-to-understand solution.

## What skills does a translator need?

Translation can be an incredibly complex task, and translators are required to have a broad range of skills. In certain countries, such as the United States, there are also legal requirements that need to be met in order to complete certain tasks.

While software solutions are able to provide some level of support, in order to offer the very best translations possible, translators will need to:

- Have complete fluency in the chosen languages
- Motivation to provide the best results possible
- Very high level of written and verbal communication skills
- Clear attention to detail
- Very high levels of accuracy
- An ability to work under pressure
- Capable of being able to meet tight deadlines
- Knowledge of the required topics, particularly for legal and medical translations
- A degree or certification in communications or translation is also beneficial

## Why are translators required?

As the world continues to become ever more connected, effective translation has never been more important. Businesses and organizations are now able to work with partners in other countries with ease, but this often means having to deal with foreign languages and different cultures.

Translators can help to make this a seamless experience and ensure that there are no mistakes or miscommunication. While there are certain machines and software that are able to provide basic translations, such as the Google Translate option, these and software still fall far short of what is required in a professional setting. Machine translation will, without a doubt, be a thing of the future.

For international businesses or products, an experienced translator is required. They are able to ensure that the phrases and colloquialisms are correct, providing that necessary human touch and review. This personal touch ensures that there are no embarrassing mistakes or errors that could result in major misunderstandings.
